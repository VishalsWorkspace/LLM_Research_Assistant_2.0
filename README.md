## Introduction

**LLM-Research_assistant 2.0** is an intelligent assistant designed to streamline your research workflow by allowing you to interact directly with your PDF documents using **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. This tool enables you to upload PDF files, embed their content for efficient retrieval, and then ask questions about the documents, receiving concise and relevant answers directly from the LLM.

This project aims to bridge the gap between static research documents and dynamic, AI-powered insights, making information extraction and analysis faster and more intuitive for researchers, students, and professionals.

---

## Features

* **PDF Upload & Processing:** Easily upload PDF documents for analysis.
* **Vector Database Integration:** Efficiently embeds PDF content into a vector store for fast and accurate retrieval.
* **LLM-Powered Q&A:** Ask natural language questions about your uploaded PDFs and get answers generated by a Large Language Model.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** (If applicable, describe your UI here, e.g., "Intuitive web interface for seamless interaction.")
* **Local LLM Support:** Designed to work with local LLM inference servers (e.g., Ollama), ensuring data privacy and reducing reliance on external APIs.

---

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run LLM-Research_assistant 2.0 on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Python 3.9+**
* **pip** (Python package installer)
* **Git** (for cloning the repository)
* **A Local LLM Inference Server:**
    * **Ollama (Recommended):** Download and install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download). After installation, pull a model (e.g., Llama 2): `ollama pull llama2`. Ensure Ollama is running (`ollama serve` in your terminal or via the application).
    * *Alternatively, other local LLM servers can be configured, but Ollama is recommended for ease of use.*

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/LLM-Research_assistant-2.0.git](https://github.com/your-username/LLM-Research_assistant-2.0.git)
    cd LLM-Research_assistant-2.0
    ```
    (Remember to replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username.)

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
    * **Windows:**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * **macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    (Make sure you have a `requirements.txt` file in your project's root directory listing all necessary Python libraries like `langchain`, `ollama`, `pypdf`, `faiss-cpu`, etc.)

### Running the Application

Once all prerequisites are met and dependencies are installed:

1.  **Ensure your local LLM server (e.g., Ollama) is running.** It should be listening on `http://localhost:11434` (or your configured port).
2.  **Start the LLM-Research_assistant 2.0 application:**
    ```bash
    python main.py # Or whatever your main application entry point is (e.g., app.py)
    ```
    You should see output indicating the server is running, likely on `http://127.0.0.1:5000` (or another local port).

---

## Usage

### Uploading PDFs

1.  Access the application in your web browser (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5000`).
2.  Look for an "Upload PDF" section or similar.
3.  Select and upload your desired PDF files. The system will process them and embed their content into the vector database. You should receive a confirmation message once completed.

### Asking Questions

1.  After successful PDF embedding, navigate to the "Ask a Question" or "Query PDF" section.
2.  Type your question related to the uploaded documents into the input field.
3.  Submit your question. The LLM will process it using the embedded PDF content and provide a relevant answer.

---

## Configuration

* **LLM Endpoint:** By default, the application is configured to connect to `http://localhost:11434/api/generate` for LLM inference, which is the standard Ollama API endpoint. If your Ollama or other local LLM server is running on a different host or port, you will need to update this setting in your application's configuration (e.g., in a `config.py` file, environment variable, or directly in the `llm_interface.py` module).

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, refer to these common problems and solutions:

* **`ConnectionRefusedError` or `Max retries exceeded`:**
    * **Problem:** This indicates that your local LLM inference server (e.g., Ollama) is not running or is not accessible on the configured port (`http://localhost:11434`).
    * **Solution:** Ensure Ollama is running (you can start it with `ollama serve` in a terminal). Verify that no firewall (e.g., Windows Defender Firewall) is blocking the connection to port `11434`.
* **PDF Processing Errors:**
    * **Problem:** The application fails to process PDF files.
    * **Solution:** Check if your PDF files are valid and not corrupted. Ensure all necessary PDF parsing libraries are installed (check your `requirements.txt`).
* **Irrelevant LLM Responses:**
    * **Problem:** The LLM provides answers that don't seem related to the PDF content.
    * **Solution:**
        * Confirm the LLM model in Ollama is fully downloaded and loaded.
        * Verify that the embedding model used for the vector store is appropriate and correctly configured.
        * Experiment with different LLM models or fine-tune the prompts used to query the LLM.
